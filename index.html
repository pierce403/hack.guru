    <h1>Hackers Hack</h1>

    <p>The war has been over for ages now, yet people still persist with the silly notion that "hacking" is something unrelated to security.  The truth is that the war had already been lost when ESR first published his ridiculous jargonfile in an attempt to take the word back.</p>
    
    <p>To hack is to break something, and make it better.</p>
