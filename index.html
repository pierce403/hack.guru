    <h1>Hackers Hack</h1>

    <p>
    The war has been over for ages now, yet there are those who still persist with the silly
    notion that 'hacking' is something unrelated to security. The truth is that the war had
    already been lost when ESR first published his ridiculous jargonfile in an attempt to redefine
    the word to how it was used within a small following at MIT.

    To hack is to break something, and make it better.  A hacker has the drive to figure out what
    makes something tick, what makes it bend, and ultimately what makes it break.  If you aren't
    breaking shit, you aren't hacking.
